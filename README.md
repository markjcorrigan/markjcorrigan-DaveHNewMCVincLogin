Hi.
I set myself a challenge to convert Dave Hollingworth's Registration and Login course, created a while ago, tow work on his new MVC framework, released this year.
I do not say that I have understood all the issues as his MVC course now deals with a number of new approaches + php v 8+ and declare(strict_types=1) etc.
My code is working at this moment and I am hoping Dave will find the time to look at this or provide an upgrade to his codebase for Registration and Login that works with the new MVC.
I am currently busy adding the final touches to the profile section and I am currently struggling with the Admin panel.
Anyway, long story short, the code I have is working but I am sure that many fixes will be required to make it 100% compatible with the new MVC framework.

Mark.
